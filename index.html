    <p>
      I'm Clara, and I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Code Fellows Intro to Software Development
      course. I plan to take the Advanced JavaScript course and decide whether I want to focus on the front end, back end,
      or full stack.

<!--
As a student, I want to create an About Me page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML.
As an eventual jobseeker, I want to get practice in creating a portfolio page so that I can make myself appealing to
potential employers.
As an eventual jobseeker, I would like for potential employers to quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio,
my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
As a developer, I want to use semantic markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I
prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
